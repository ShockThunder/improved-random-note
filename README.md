# Improved Random Note Obsidian Plugin

This plugin improves interaction with the knowledge base in so-called wandering mode by opening Random Notes

Unlike the core plugin and its analogs like Smart Random Note, the plugin combines the following options:

- Opening a random note without having to create an intermediate search query
- Ability to open a random note in a new panel
- Adding the plugin icon to the command bar
- Excluding notes from specific folders from the output. Useful for excluding Archives, Templates and other service folders.
- Option to open notes only with a certain tag and in combination with exclusion of certain directories from output.

The plugin is developed specifically for the Second Brain project (https://second-brain.ru/).
