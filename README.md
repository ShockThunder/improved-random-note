# Impoved Random Note Obsidian Plugin

This plugin dramatically improves interaction with the knowledge base in so-called wandering mode.  Allows you to retrieve a random note from the knowledge base according to the criteria you set.

The following options are available:

- Open a random note in a new pane.
- Add a plugin icon to the command bar
- Exclude from output notes that are in specific folders (can be useful for excluding archived folders, or folders with daily notes, templates)
- Open notes only with a certain tag.

Developed specially for the project Second Brain (https://second-brain.ru/).
