# Improved Random Note Obsidian Plugin

Improved interaction with the knowledge base in so-called wandering mode by opening Random Notes

Unlike its analogs combines the following options:

- Opening a random note without having to create an intermediate search term
- Opening a random note in a new panel
- Excluding notes from specific folders from the output. Useful for excluding Archives, Templates and other service folders.
- Can  open notes only with a certain tag and in combination with exclusion of certain folders from output.

The plugin is developed specifically for the Second Brain project (https://second-brain.ru/).
